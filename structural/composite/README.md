The Composite pattern is used to structure objects in a tree-like hierarchy. Here, each node of the tree can be composed of either child node(s) or be a leaf (no children objects). This pattern allows the client to work with these components uniformly, that is, a single object can be treated exactly how a group of objects is treated.
You should consider using the Composite pattern in your software design when you encounter scenarios that involve hierarchies of objects or structures that can be composed of individual objects and composite objects, and you want to treat them uniformly.
