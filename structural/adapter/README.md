The Adapter pattern allows classes that have different interfaces (properties/methods of an object) to work together.
This pattern is useful if an API is modified or new implementations are added to it. In this case, if the other parts of a system are still using the old API, the Adapter pattern will translate the interface so that the two can work together.
