The Observer pattern is an important behavioral design pattern. It allows objects (observers) that have subscribed to an event to wait for input and react to it when notified. Therefore, they donâ€™t have to continuously keep checking whether the input has been provided or not. The main subject maintains a list of all the observers, and whenever the event occurs, it notifies the observers so they can update their states accordingly.
